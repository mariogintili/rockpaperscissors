## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This task was assigned to us by @alexpeattie it's week 7 at Makers Academy,
and we've been introduced to Javascript for the first time. Our stack:

* Javascript, using jQuery
* Ruby
* HTML & CSS
* Git version control
* Test-driven-development with RSpec and Jasmin.

### Issues to be resolved

* Cursor does not fade away when the cursor is hovering of **h2**
* Front-end could be better
